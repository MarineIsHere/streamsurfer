Stream Surfer
=============

Stream Surfer â€” probe utiliy for HTTP video streaming. The utility detects errors in
HTTP Live Streams (Apple HLS) and health of any HTTP resources. It may be used as
regular monitoring tool and stress testing for mediaservers (and any HTTP-servers too).

Features are:

 * parse M3U8-playlists (master and single-bitrate playlists)
 * detect bad playlists format (empty playlists, incorrect chunk durations)
 * check HTTP response statuses
 * collects response time statistics
 * webreports to represent collected statistics
 * integration with Zabbix (http://zabbix.com) monitoring software

**The code in alpha. Undocumented. Not completed. Though it works.**

Planned features:

 * probe chunks with `mediainfo` utility (from ffmpeg)
 * REST HTTP to represent collected data and utility control
 * aggregate and analyze statistics from other hlsprobe nodes
 * persistent storage for statistics and reports generation

This utility can't be used for HLS playback.

`streamsurfer` is an improved port of Python `hlsprobe` (https://github.com/grafov/hlsprobe).

Install
-------

### Use binary

TODO Instructions follows later.

### Build from sources

You need Go language (http://golang.org) environment installed.
Then:

	go get github.com/grafov/m3u8
	go get github.com/gorilla/mux
	go get github.com/hoisie/mustache
	git clone https://github.com/grafov/hlsprobe2
	cd hlsprobe2
	sudo make install

The code includes Bootstrap 2 (http://getbootstrap.com) library (under Apache License).
It may be packaged with `hlsprobe` due GPLv3 license.
To simplify installation Bootstrap code yet included in `hlsprobe` package.
Later it will be splitted and Bootstrap will be downloaded separately.
